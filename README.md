Fine-tune language models to generate Flutter code in your personal coding style! Transform natural language descriptions into custom widgets, screens, and components that match your unique patterns and preferences.

## 🎯 Overview

This toolkit provides a complete workflow for Flutter developers to create personalized code generation models:

- 📊 **Data preparation** tools for creating training datasets from your existing Flutter code
- 🧠 **Fine-tuning scripts** optimized for code generation models (CodeLlama, StarCoder, etc.)
- 🔍 **Evaluation methods** to ensure quality and style consistency
- 🔌 **Deployment options** for integrating with your development environment

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Check out our comprehensive [Flutter Code Generation Fine-tuning Guide](GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on each step of the process.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Flutter/Dart knowledge
- GPU access (local or cloud) for training

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-codegen-finetuner.git
cd flutter-codegen-finetuner
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your data:
```bash
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py --source your_flutter_project_path
```

4. Run fine-tuning:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --config configs/default.json
```

## 🔍 Examples

```python
# Example: Generate a custom Flutter button
from flutter_codegen import FlutterCodeGenerator

generator = FlutterCodeGenerator.from_pretrained("path/to/your/model")
code = generator.generate("Create a gradient button with rounded corners and a shadow")
print(code)
```
